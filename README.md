This is an exploration of how to bootstrap an *Introduction to R*
workshop for [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/)

## Assumption

  - Library data is not unique

  - Library data may have some consistently unique challenges

  - Data savvy skills should emphasize technique, tools, and approach
    
      - Techniques: Reproducible, Scripting
      - Tools: R / RStudio / Tidyverse
      - Approach: Open Source and CC-BY are foundational.

  - For anyone intending to develop core competency as a data savvy
    staffer, i.e. become more than a comfortable beginner, using a fully
    capable data science scripting language is the best midterm
    investment from a skill building perspective.

Narrative: R has become and tool of choice for data science
explorations. **R** - a statistical programming language - and
**Tidyverse** - a consistent way of applying and learning data science -
are an excellent toolkit that can can be broadly applied when producing
(and documenting) data summation projects. This toolkit is an excellent
option for advanced beginners to advanced intermediates. For one, you
can build on all that you learn, rather than have to learn 12 different
applications. Additionally, R as a tool, along with version control,
lends itself to reproducibility, portfolio building, on the way writing
reports in various formats (MS Word, PPT, slides, web pages, blogs,
dashboards, PDF, etc.). As you become engaged with these best practices
you will spend less time on the data science and more time engaging with
the data. You’ll write various reports from one script (web scrape, web
publishing, PDF docs) by employing extensible data savvy techniques.
While R (or Python) can have a steep learning curve, the tool will carry
a data miner farther than entry level tools – which, while designed for
easy of use, quickly reach an efficiency barrier). What better to use
scalable techniques that were built for sharing, documentation,
reproducibility, openness, and collaboration.

## Process

1.  [x] Explore OpenRefine CrossRef dataset (exploring\_crossref.Rmd)
2.  [x] Fork Data Carpentry’s *R for Soc Sci*
3.  [x] Apply OpenRefine Examples over top of DC’s *R for Soc Sci*
4.  [ ] Pitch to A.Zoss
5.  [ ] Pitch back to C.Eardman (meanwhile, CE will begin a loop in at
    his end)
6.  [ ] Engage with people working on the [Library Carpentry R
    lesson](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-r)
7.  What can be done efficiently?
