## Questions 

- What is R? (data first)
- Why R Studio? (IDE)
- Why data science? 
- Are we going to do _machine learning_ ... -- Can I take the blue pill now?
- What is the Tidyverse? (consistent, modern, data science)

    - What is tidy data
    

### Questions we'll answer along the way

- What about **Excel**
- Importance of **Reproducibility**
- What is **Version Control**
- What is **Literate Coding**
- I work in a library, why are you talking to me about **coding**
- What is **Collaborative Coding**
- **Who is your** most likely **collaborator**
- How many **versions** of your **reports do you** want to **make**

## Let's get started

```r
ggplot(data = ____, aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +
  geom____()
```


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=8}
plot1 <- ggplot(data = fct_count(starwars$eye_color, sort = T) %>% head(6), aes(x = f, y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab("count")

plot2 <- ggplot(data = starwars, ) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = fct_rev(fct_lump(fct_infreq(eye_color), n = 5)))) +
  geom_bar(data = starwars %>% filter(eye_color == "orange"), aes(eye_color), fill = "orange") +
  annotate("text", label = "Orange eyes\n       are rare", x = 2, y = 4.2) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Eye color of Star Wars Characters",
       x = "",
       caption = "data source: dplyr::starwars") +
  theme_bw()
  

plot3 <- ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = fct_lump(fct_infreq(eye_color), n = 5))) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = gender)) +
  xlab(NULL)

ggpubr::ggarrange(plot1, plot2)

plot3
```
