Very **simple** visualizations

- grammar of graphics
- Two Variable scatter plot

    - continuous and discrete
    - geom_plot(aes(x = height, y = mass))
    - geom_plot(aes(x = height, y = mass, size = year))
    - geom_plot(aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender))
    - geom_plot(aes(x = height, y = mass), size = 4, color = "dodgerblue"))
    
- Categorical Data

    - forcats is a must `fct_infreq`
    - stringr and regex is gonna show up 
    
        - `str_count`
        - `str_replace()`
